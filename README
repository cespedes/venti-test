Many of the things from this repo will be moved to github.com/cespedes/venti in the future.

* Structure of a venti block:
  + Score, Type, size, data.
  + The score is the SHA1 of the data.
* "type" is a byte.  Venti doesn't care what you use there, but there are
  some predefined ones with this meaning (convention among clients):
  + VtRoot
    - This is the entry point for a group of blocks. The VtRoot has
      there fields:
      - name      [128]byte
      - type      [128]byte
      - score     [20]byte // to a VtDir block
      - blocksize uint32
      - prev      [20]byte // last root block
  + VtDir
    - This is a list of several VtEntry.  Each VtEntry is 40 bytes:
      - gen   uint32   // generation number
      - psize uint16   // pointer block size.  Must be a multiple of 20 bytes (score size).
      - dsize uint16   // data block size.  Should be a power of 2
      - flags byte     // 
      - _     [5]byte  // padding?
      - size  uint48   // uint48 doesn't exist in Go; this is just 6 bytes in big-endian.
      - score [20]byte //
  + VtData
    - This is just a bunch of bytes, with no predefined structure.
  + VtDir+1
    - This is a list of several scores to VtDir
  + VtData+1
    - This is a list of several scores to VtData
  + VtDir+N
    (2 <= N <= 7)
    - This is a list of several scores to VtDir+(N-1)
  + VtData+N
    (2 <= N <= 7)
    - This is a list of several scores to VtData+(N-1)
